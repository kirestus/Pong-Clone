My version of the classic Game Pong, Written in c++. Works on IOS and Windows, and linux if you are willing to make sure you have the right libraries (I dont have a linux install to set this up right now, but if anyone ever wants it I will do it).

It's pretty true to classic pong but with a few twists:
Ball Speeds up each round
Players serve the ball 
Paddle speed effects the balls Y translation (feels like putting spin on the ball)
